# Asteroids-Deluxe-in-raylib
A remake of the classic Asteroids Deluxe in raylib 4.5. Using KE 0.1 alpha
I've made a content manager and entity manager in my style. I've called this Knightmare Engine. I've made KE as a library to the game project.
Both raylib 4.5 and KE are libraries. It took me hours to get working, as I've never had two in one before and I was getting link errors.
